# WoT Inspector

WoT Inspector is a simple iOS application that allows you to inspect much data provided by Wargaming's public World of Tanks apis.

I created this project within a week to learn how to manage multiple Xcode projects to separate modules and how to work with the storyboard.

I also used this as a chance to familiarize myself with UITableView and UICollectionView.
